                code: ENGLISH2092
                desc: >
                  The wildly successful Harry Potter series has been noted for its capacity to cross traditional boundaries. Conventional wisdom claims that young girls won’t read a book with a male protagonist and young boys won’t read a book by a female author, yet Harry Potter has found an enthusiastic readership among children of both sexes. Age boundaries have proven to be equally elastic; the popularity of the series among adults has even prompted the creation of an adult-friendly edition of the series with dark cover art suitable for reading on public transportation. The flexibility of the series may relate to its roots in a wide variety of genres including the gothic novel, detective fiction, fantasy, adventure, and even the dystopian novel. This course will examine the Harry Potter series in relation to all these genres. We will read all seven books alongside other novels and short stories that illustrate the generic conventions Rowling is using.

                  This course interrogates the limits of human knowledge in the arts, the social sciences, and the sciences and it asks questions about the tools we use to arrive at “meaning.” It poses the question not only of how we know what we know, but also of how we can be sure that we know what we know. What, in other words, does it mean “to know”? Do we control outcomes, or are they due partly or entirely to chance? Does our world actually have meaning or do we just create meanings? How, finally, does the creation of meaning take place?
