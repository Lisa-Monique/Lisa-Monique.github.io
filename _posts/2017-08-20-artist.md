<p>Although I'm scientist by training and profession, I'm also a creative by nature and have always turned to the arts to outwardly express my internal emotions. As a visual artist, I produce highly detailed paintings and drawings using acrylic paint, coloured pencils, graphite and charcoal with a general focus on still-life imagery and, infrequently, portraits and landscapes. Shop my work: <a href="{{site.art_link}}">Lisa-Monique Fine Art</a></p>
<p>Aside from my mixed media pieces, I also produce:
<ul>
	<li>Logo designs</li>
	<li>Business card designs</li>
	<li>Website designs</li>
</ul>
