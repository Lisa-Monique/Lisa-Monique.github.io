<p>Prior to attending university, my only exposure to computer science was self-directed. I therefore greatly appreciated the opportunity provided by hackathons which are events dedicated to creating supportive environments where novice hackers can learn to code by developing functioning software or hardware in 24-48 hours with the help of mentors, tech experts and company representatives.
