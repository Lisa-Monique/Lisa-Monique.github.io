<p>On March 25th, 2018, the Women in Technology Society (WiTS) hosted 150 women from across Canada for Western University's first and only hackathon designed to encourage women in tech: SheHacks.  Over the past year, I was the Communications Director of WiTS and therefore had the opportunity to help organize SheHacks II.</p>
<p>The mission of WiTS is to encourage, connect, and inspire women to explore the technology industry and SheHacks II was created to encourage women* from all backgrounds and skill sets to attend a hackathon in a fun, safe, and inclusive environment.</p>
