    <p>I am one of 15 recipients in the North American region or the Generation Google Scholarship for 2018 (Value: $5,000 CAD). This scholarship supports students from historically underrepresented groups in tech and aims to inspire and help them become future leaders and role models in computing and technology by breaking down the barriers that prevent them from entering these fields. The scholarship recognizes students for academic excellence, exceptional leadership, demonstrating a passion for technology and acting as a role model within their community. As a recipient of this scholarship for the 2018 cycle, I attended the 2018 Google Scholar Retreat at the Googleplex in Mountain View, CA in August.</p>
