<p>I'm currently employed as a Bioinformatician in the lab of Dr. Adam Shlien at The Hospital for Sick Children. This lab uses the tools of modern sequence-based genomics to discover the mutations that are present in the genomes of pediatric cancer patients, and is directly involved with the  introduction of cutting-edge genomics into clinical care.</p>
<p>In my role, I primarily work with the Kids Cancer Sequencing (KiCS) Program for which I: 
<ul>
	<li>conduct genomic and transcriptomic analyses;</li>
	<li>maintain and improve existing analysis pipelines and developed novel pipelines as necessary to meet labâ€™s research goals; and</li>
	<li>provide technical expertise and assistance to students, fellows and researchers.</li>
</ul>
