<p>I'm currently employed as a Bioinformatician in the lab of Dr. Adam Shlien (Associate Director, Translational Genetics, DPLM; Scientist, Genetics and Genome Biology; co-Director, KiCS cancer sequencing program). This lab uses the tools of modern sequence-based genomics to discover the mutations that are present in the genomes of pediatric cancer patients, and is directly involved with the  introduction of cutting-edge genomics, such as whole genome sequencing, into clinical practice.</p>
<p>I first joined this lab in the summer of 2018 as a Summer Research Student in the SickKids Summer Research (SSuRe) program. For my project, I explored the association between DNA methylation and transcriptional output in a large dataset of over 450,000 DNA probes and over 5,000 cancer samples spanning 31 cancer types.

<p>Following this, I returned to Western University to complete the final year of my undergraduate program. I then rejoined the lab in August 2019 as a Precision Medicine Research Technologist and have since been promoted to the position of Bioinformatician. In my current role, I provide technical (data transfer, analysis and programming) assistance to students, fellows and researchers in the lab. I also develop novel analysis pipelines and maintain and improve existing pipelines. Finally, I perform analyses for the SickKids Cancer Sequencing (KiCS) Program which is a Precision Oncology program with the goal of learning more about the genomes of participantsâ€™ tumour and healthy cells in order help guide their therapy and future surveillance.</p>
