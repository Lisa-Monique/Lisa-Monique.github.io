        <p>This summer, I have been participating in the SickKids Summer Research (SSuRe) program in the lab of Dr. Adam Shlien (Associate Director, Translational Genetics, DPLM; Scientist, Genetics and Genome Biology; co-Director, KiCS cancer sequencing program). This lab uses the tools of modern sequence-based genomics to discover the mutations that are present in the genomes of paediatric cancer patients, and is directly involved with the  introduction of cutting-edge genomics, such as whole genome sequencing, into clinical practice.</p>
        <p>For my project, I wrote a variety of Python and R scripts in order to draw useful insights from a large dataset of over 450,000 DNA probes and over 5,000 cancer samples spanning 31 cancer types. I presented my findings in the form of a written abstract as well as a poster presentation.</p>
